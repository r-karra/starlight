# About Me

I am a data science Intern focused on AI applications. While this often means machine learning and deep learning, it also includes web app development and other efforts. AI is only one component o[...]  
I am currently learning Artificial Intelligence using platforms such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshkumarkarra), [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), and exploring Quantum Computing with [Qi[...]  
I am also a big fan of [HQPINNs (Hybrid Classical & Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15015) and learning about them via [Microsoft QNN](https://www.microsoft.c[...]  
I'm particularly excited by technologies emerging from [Answer.AI](https://answer.ai/) (led by Jeremy Howard), for example [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/docs/) and [MonsterUI](https://monsterui.ans[...]  
My primary hobby is learning new technologies. I'm inspired by people and projects like [Jeremy Howard](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZWdEJ54AAAAJ&hl=en), [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipe[...]  

## 👨‍💻 How to get into data science 👩🏻‍💻

I recommend working through the [fast.ai courses](https://course.fast.ai/). They teach excellent material in an approachable way and let you apply what you learn to real problems quickly.
**Tinker with everything.** Try things instead of asking “Would it work if I did X?”. The fastest way to learn is to try it and see.
**Do projects.** Work on projects during and after courses. Build stuff — that's where most of your learning will happen.
**Teach to learn.** Teaching (for example, blogging) is a great way to solidify knowledge while building a public portfolio. See my FAQ for tips on getting started.
**Keep at it.** Learning is uncomfortable at times. Frustration usually means you're on the edge of an important concept; persevere and you'll grow.
