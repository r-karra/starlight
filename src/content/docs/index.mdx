# About Me

I am a data science Intern focused on AI applications. While this often means machine learning and deep learning, it also includes web app development and other efforts. AI is only one component of a successful AI application.
I am currently learning Artificial Intelligence using platforms such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshkumarkarra), [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), and exploring Quantum Computing with [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and [Google Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq).
I am also a big fan of [HQPINNs (Hybrid Classical & Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15015) and learning about them via [Microsoft QNN](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/quantum-neural-networks/).
I'm particularly excited by technologies emerging from [Answer.AI](https://answer.ai/) (led by Jeremy Howard), for example [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/docs/) and [MonsterUI](https://monsterui.answer.ai/).
My primary hobby is learning new technologies. I'm inspired by people and projects like [Jeremy Howard](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZWdEJ54AAAAJ&hl=en), [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/), [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit), and the work on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshkumarkarra).

## üë®‚Äçüíª How to get into data science üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

I recommend working through the [fast.ai courses](https://course.fast.ai/). They teach excellent material in an approachable way and let you apply what you learn to real problems quickly.
**Tinker with everything.** Try things instead of asking ‚ÄúWould it work if I did X?‚Äù. The fastest way to learn is to try it and see.
**Do projects.** Work on projects during and after courses. Build stuff ‚Äî that's where most of your learning will happen.
**Teach to learn.** Teaching (for example, blogging) is a great way to solidify knowledge while building a public portfolio. See my FAQ for tips on getting started.
**Keep at it.** Learning is uncomfortable at times. Frustration usually means you're on the edge of an important concept; persevere and you'll grow.
