<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a data science Intern focused on AI applications. While this often means machine learning and deep learning it often means web app development and other things. AI is only a component of a successful AI application.</p>
<p>I am currently learning Artificial Intelligence using the platforms namely,
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshkumarkarra">kaggle</a>,
  <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> and Quantum Computing using
  <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>, <a href="https://quantumai.google/cirq">Google Cirq</a>.
  I am also a big fan of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15015" target="_blank">HQPINNs (Hibrid (Classical and Quantum) Physics-Informed Neural Networks)</a> and
  I am learning about them using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/quantum-neural-networks/">Microsoft QNN</a>. 
  I'm particularly excited by the cutting-edge technologies emerging from <a href="https://answer.ai/" target="_blank">Answer.AI</a>, led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyphoward/" target="_blank">Jeremy Howard</a>, specifically <a href="https://fastht.ml/docs/" target="_blank">FastHTML</a> and <a href="https://monsterui.answer.ai/" target="_blank">MonsterUI</a>.
</p>

<p>My primary hobby is learning a new technology, I inspired by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZWdEJ54AAAAJ&hl=en">Jermey Howard</a>
  , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a>,
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/">Andrew Ng</a>,
  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit">IBM Quantum Computing</a> and
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshkumarkarra">Google's Kaggle</a>, where I'm learning my desired technologies.</p>

<h1>👨‍💻 How to get into data science 👩🏻‍💻</h1>
<p>I recommend working through the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">fastai courses</a>. These are fantastic courses that teach great content, but also in an approachable way that enable you to use what your learn on real problems right away.</p>
<p><strong>Tinker with everything.</strong> Try to never ask “Would it work if I did X?” or “Can I accomplish X by doing Y?”. Instead, try it and see if it works. It’s worth the time investment.</p>
<p><strong>Do projects</strong> Do projects in parallel with courses, and after courses. Don’t wait. Build stuff. Doing projects should be where you put most of your time.</p>
<p><strong>Teach to learn</strong> Teaching is a great way to learn, and if you have a record of it you build a portfolio at the same time! I am a fan of doing this via blogging <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045">for many reasons</a>. See my FAQ for some help getting started.</p>
<p><strong>Keep at it</strong> and be tenacious. There is discomfort with learning any skill. You’ll be frustrated at times. That’s a sign that there’s a concept worth learning and once you do figure it out you’ll have made a big step forward.</p>
